# Create a function that receives three parameters, calculates a result depending on the given operator, and returns it.
# Print the result of the function.
# The input comes as three parameters â€“ an operator as a string and two integer numbers.
# The operator can be one of the following:  "multiply", "divide", "add", "subtract".
# Example
# Input	        Output
# subtract
# 5
# 4             1
# divide
# 8
# 4	            2
