# You have a water tank with a capacity of 255 liters. On the first line,
# you will receive n â€“ the number of lines, which will follow.
# On the following n lines, you will receive liters of water (integers),
# which you should pour into your tank. If the capacity is not enough,
# print "Insufficient capacity!" and continue reading the next line. On the last line, print the liters in the tank.
# Example
