# You seem to be doing great at your first job, so your boss decides to give you as your next task something more
# challenging. You have to accept all the new products coming in the bakery and finally gather some statistics.
# You will be receiving key-value pairs on separate lines separated by ": " until you receive the command "statistics".
# Sometimes you may receive a product more than once. In that case, you have to add the new quantity to the existing
# one.When you receive the "statistics" command, print the following:
# "Products in stock:
# - {product1}: {quantity1}
# - {product2}: {quantity2}
# â€¦
# - {productN}: {quantityN}
# Total Products: {count_all_products}
# Total Quantity: {sum_all_quantities}"
# Input
# bread: 4
# cheese: 2
# ham: 1
# bread: 1
# statistics
# Output
# Products in stock:
# - bread: 5
# - cheese: 2
# - ham: 1
# Total Products: 3
# Total Quantity: 8
# Input
# eggs: 10
# bread: 6
# cheese: 8
# milk: 7
# statistics
# Output
# Products in stock:
# - eggs: 10
