# Write a program that finds how many times a word is used in a string.
# The output is a single number indicating the number of times the string contains the word.
# Note that letter case does not matter â€“ it is case-insensitive.
# Examples
# Input	                                                                        Output

# How do you plan on achieving that? How? How can you even think of that?
